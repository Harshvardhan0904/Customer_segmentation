# Customer_segmentation
Overview

This project applies clustering techniques to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other relevant features. Customer segmentation helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and enhance decision-making.
Features

    Clustering Algorithms: Uses k-means, hierarchical, or DBSCAN clustering.
    Data Visualization: Graphical representation of clusters using PCA, t-SNE, and scatter plots.
    Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and normalization.

Technologies Used

    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
Dataset

The project uses customer transaction data or behavioral datasets, preprocessed for optimal clustering performance.
Future Enhancements

    Integration with a web dashboard for interactive visualization.
    Automated clustering algorithm selection based on dataset characteristics.
    Implementation of deep learning for advanced customer profiling.
